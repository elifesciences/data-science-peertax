      "'\\n            This is a well-written report from leading investigators in the field of HTLV-I replication. In this study, the authors screened more than 19 000 cells derived from five naturally infected T cell clones isolated from PBMCs of HTLV-1 healthy donors. They used single-molecule RNA FISH to quantify, at the single cell level, the transcripts of two main products of the HTLV-I pX region, Tax encoded by the plus-strand of the provirus and HBZ encoded by its minus-strand. They observed a strong intra- and inter-clonal heterogeneity in the expression of \\n                tax and\\n                 hbz genes with Tax being expressed at high levels in few cells whereas \\n                hbz is expressed at lower levels in most cells. They also report that both genes are transcribed in intermittent bursts and that tax expression is enhanced in the absence of HBZ but that \\n                hbz expression is enhanced by Tax. Finally, they show that HBZ expression is mostly associated with G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and that its abundance correlates with the nuclear volume. They conclude that the main function of this frequent low level of \\n                hbz transcript and protein is to maintain clonal persistence and that conversely, intense transient intermittent bursts of \\n                tax drive viral replication and clonal proliferation while escaping the robust anti Tax CTL response. These results strongly suggest that the plus strand of HTLV-I is expressed in bursts \\n                in vivo explaining the hitherto unexplained paradoxical observations of a strong anti-Tax immune response in all immuno-competent HTLV-I infected individuals while Tax is undetectable in their freshly isolated PBMCs. This is an important study in the field that defeats multiple previous paradigms. The following experiments should strengthen the manuscript:\\n             \\xa0 \\n                \\n                    \\n                        Authors used short-term cultures of activated cells in order to isolate individual cells.

More uninfected clones should be tested. Furthermore, in order to validate \\n                            tax and \\n                            hbz probes, they show the specificity/sensitivity of smFISH on one clone generated from HTLV-I infected cell lines like having different expression levels of Tax and HBZ.\\n                    \\n                    \\n                        It is important to show the viral load and the status of expression of Tax and HBZ in total PBMCs of the 5 HTLV-I positive donors, and compare it with that of the 5 T cell clones that were selected. How can the authors be sure that the selected clone from each donor is a representative one of all the HTLV-1 infected cells in that individual? Did they screen other clones from each of the five donors?\\n                    \\n                    \\n                        Figure 2: Images of \\n                            tax bursts are more convincing that those of \\n                            hbz. Figure 2D shows that the estimated number of \\n                            hbz RNA per burst is around 3 to 4 with little intercellular variation, which is not classical for bursts. How can the authors rule out the possibility that these represent superposition of multiple transcripts. In 2C, they show a three-fold reduction in the frequency of \\n                            hbz bursts in the presence of actinomycine D compared to a total disappearance of \\n                            tax bursts. What is the percentage reduction of \\n                            hbz bursts relative to the reduction of total \\n                            hbz transcripts?\\n                    \\n                    \\n                        Figure 3: Estimation of intranuclear mRNA should be done in zStacks to rule out counting transcripts above and below the nucleus.\\n                    \\n                    \\n                        Figure 4: Authors show increased frequency of \\n                            hbz bursts in high tax positive cells. Again, what about the total amount of \\n                            hbz transcripts in these cells?\\n                    \\n                    \\n                        Elevated \\n                            tax and \\n                            hbz expression in S and G2/M phase of the cell cycle is solely based on the integrated intensity of the DAPI stained nucleus (2n versus 4n). It would be nice to perform synchronization of cells to confirm these findings.\\n                    \\n                    \\n                        Supplementary Figure 9: The negative control (uninfected cells) and clone E should be shown.\\n                    \\n                    \\n                        Supplementary Figure 10: The odds ratio for G2/M phase is much higher for cells with >4 \\n                            hbz compared to cells with >99 tax whereas that for S phase is quite similar.
