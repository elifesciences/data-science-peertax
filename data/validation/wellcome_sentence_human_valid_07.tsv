21258	Thus, when estimating for true burden of malaria, could the authors clarify whether B TRUE is a value that has been adjusted two times?	2	0			3	Impact/Novelty
14645	Limitations to the paper were not discussed, but are detail is in linked papers.	6	-1	This sentence doesn't seem to be correct (the second part makes no grammatical sense) but it seems to be commenting on the quality of the paper in a general way so I classified it as 6		4	Text/Exposition Clarity

16714	There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy, mainly due to the ethical and logistical constraints.	0	0	It's either 0 or 6: if it's describing the paper by saying that it does not present enough data about the medicines for malaria, then it's a 6; but if it's either describing the content of the paper (as in, the paper itself saying that data is lacking) or the general state of the field, then it would be classified as 0. Impossible to classify with more contextual information.  		6	Main Discussion
9346	This is problematic since the paper focuses on the role of CTCF in various infection and latency scenarios.	6	-1				
10441	This is a very useful BIGSdb functionality as it allows capturing the entire sequence variation rather than just its summary based on allele identifiers.	2	1	Could also be a 3?		Assign a "sentiment" to the sentences:	
5944	The authors use gender and social norms almost interchangeably; it would be important to understand if they think they differ at all.	4	-1			0	Neutral sentiment (or no sentiment)
2477	The activity shown in the paper can be a good example showing this kind of possibility.	6	1	Could also be a 3? 		-1	Negative sentiment (e.g. critiques, disagreement, etc.)
12609	Serosurveys without concurrent estimates of vaccination coverage can be valuable to immunization programs but would not have been included in this systematic review.	6	-1	Could potentially be 2? It's not really talking about a method, just about something not included in the review, so I've left it as 6.		1	Positive sentiment (e.g. praises, compliments, etc.)
19765	Significant issues The summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the data is very clear and comprehensive.	6	1	Again, I'd need a bit more context from this sentence. I assume the 'Significant issues' is a title of a section and then the sentence starts with 'the summary...			
6655	Their findings certainly echo my own experience with sharing INDEPTH data through the Wellcome-funded iSHARE2 inititiative.	6	1			Category explanation:

3887	Overall the study is technically sound and clearly demonstrates the broad applicability and utility of the knocksideways approach in P. berghei, forming a complement to the recent publication of a similar proof of principle which tagged 12 targets in P. falciparum (PMID: 28288121).	6	1	Could also be a 3? Discusses the impact and compares the to another paper		2	This category groups sentences about the following topics:
15110	Although it seems likely that most of the observed proteome changes are due to increased v-Src kinase activity, no control was included to rule out the possibility that some of the changes might be due to a noncatalytic function of overexpressed v-Src.	2	-1				- Statistics and Data Analysis
14359	The paper is thorough and well-written, and validly attempts to progress our understanding of this area of research.	6	1				- Models and Simulations
19074	Hepatotoxicity by pyrrolizidine alkaloids, often a composition in Ayurvedic medicine has been long recognized.	0	0	This is classified as no category because it's simply describing what the paper says or what it's about			- Experimental Techniques

840	But the stimuli are typically counter-balanced or randomly assigned across experimental conditions (e.g., studied items or non-studied items) and across subjects, in which case, modeling random effects for the stimuli is not necessary.	2	0			5	This category groups sentences that mention previous literature on the subject.
8816	Introduction Genomic research raises a number of challenges for the informed consent process and it is not clear why there is a focus on incidental findings only, particularly as the results speak to a wider range of issues.	0	0	This is classified as no category because it's simply describing what the paper says or what it's about		6	This category groups sentences about the main points raised by the reviewer. These include, for example:
21104	Only year is in the shared data.	0	0	I don't know how to classify this since the sentence doesn't sound correct and I'm not sure if it's a simple statement about where some data is or a criticism of missing data			- General discussion about the correctness/soundness of the study
7690	The fact that LEDGF p75 has an effect on DNA damage response (figure 3c) is not new.	3	-1	Could also be 1 because it has a reference to non-textual content but realistically it's about the fact that the data isn't new.m			- Suggestions and improvements 
16387	This low depth leads to weak association with bulk RNA seq data.	2	-1	Could also be 0, 0 if it's simply describing what the paper says, would need more context			- Corrections
16144	My view as a reader is therefore that this data does not provide convincing evidence that the change in diagnostics was the driver of the small changes in mortality.	6	-1				
14026	This is highly commendable, but unfortunately also implies that partial description of each software is needed to follow-up without the need of re-reading all the original articles.	6	-1	Could also be 2 or 5, there's not enough context to tell. As to the sentiment it could well be 1 or -1, given that it compliments what they've done and then says 'but xyz'		If you think some sentences should be labeled with two or more categories, or if you have any other comment you'd like to make on the particular sentence, write your considerations in the "comments" column.

3904	In summary, a paper with high technical standards that comprehensively introduces a new conditional approach to the Plasmodium genetic toolkit that has very specific advantages of rapidity and applicability to transmission stages.	6	1	Could also be a 2 or a 3 since it mentions the quality of the paper, the quality of the techniques and the novelty			
12933	The criteria for inclusion exclusion of the events and policies listed in the Timeline of Figure 1 is not provided.	2	-1	I've put it down as 2 because it's talking about how things have been done to make a figure rather than the figure itself, but it could also be 1			
11074	Upstream regulators that were predicted to be down regulated, despite not being DE themselves’, do you mean that they are upstream regulators for down-regulated genes?	4	0
